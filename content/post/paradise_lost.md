As we grow older, our childhood perceptions are challenged. Growing up on a river in Indiana, I thought it was a pristine example of natural beauty. I’ve later learned about just how large of an impact humans have had on this stream. A downstream dam slows the flow, creating a thick layer of muck on the stream bed. Years of excessive fertilizer and pesticide use upstream has led to significantly impaired water quality. An industrial spill in the 1990s led to a massive fish kill. Levees and development have disconnected the river from important floodplain habitat. A once clear stream (named Wapahani for its “white sands”) runs brown with silt. Ignorance was bliss…

Most rivers around the world have been similarly affected by a history of human development. Dams are the most pervasive in-channel impact; nearly every stream has at least some small dams which trap sediment, block fish migration, and alter flow rates. In some cases, especially in the arid west, dams are primarily used to divert water from streams into irrigation canals or reservoirs. Overuse of streams is literally destroying them; water ceases to flow at all during certain times of the year. The most publicized example of this is the Colorado River which rarely reaches the ocean anymore[^1] but there are countless lesser-known cases.

Land use change is a similarly large-scale change; conversion of forests and grasslands to cities and farms alters inputs of water and sediment to rivers. This can create significant habitat loss and channel instability which must then be addressed to prevent further damage. Fertilizers, pesticides, improperly treated wastewater, and industrial waste all contribute to degrade water quality, leaving fewer fish to catch, scarcer rivers to play in, and less water to drink. More directly, we have channelized, diked, straightened, and piped our streams, converting them from functional amenities to engineered structures designed to move water as efficiently as possible. Rivers are not meant to be arrow-straight nor buried under concrete. What pleasure can we expect to receive from these facsimiles?

Now that I live in Colorado, I can head for the mountains to fulfill my longing for pure, unsullied riverscapes; or so I thought. Even these remote mountain streams have been shaped by the hand of man. During the Colorado gold rush in the mid-1800s, hundreds of miles of streams were subjected to placer mining, the damaging practice of digging up an entire streambed and filtering out the gold. While efficient, this has lasting impacts on stream sediment dynamics which can be observed even 100 years later. Soon after the mining boom came the railroads. The huge demand for railroad ties was satiated by logging the Colorado Rockies. Hewn timber was transported out of the mountains via natural highways – rivers. Huge stocks of lumber were sent downstream with the spring flood in massive “tie-drives”. These tie-drives reamed out stream channels and permanently altered channel morphology.

Beaver trapping and their near-extinction is arguably one of the most influential human river impacts across North America. Beaver dams quite literally shape river landscapes, creating wetland complexes that serve as important wildlife habitat, mediating sediment, nutrient, and water fluxes, and mitigating floods and other disturbances. It may seem strange to sing the praises of beaver dams just a few short paragraphs after denigrating human dams and their impacts on stream systems, but the two share little but a name. Beaver dams are small, transient, and porous while human dams are (often) large, permanent, and impassable. The widespread loss of beaver forever shaped our current riverine landscape in ways that we are just beginning to realize.

Aldo Leopold, a famous American ecologist, immortalized the curse of the ecologically educated as “one who lives alone in a world of wounds”[^2]. While this may depress you to now join this group[^3] who sees the world of rivers for what it is, I hope to leave you with some words of hope. Yes, rivers and streams have suffered at our hands; but there is still much to value in these resources. My childhood river still supports fish and waterfowl, boaters and swimmers come to play, and the city pipes its (treated) water to residents. Rivers are resilient systems; if we remove the pressures we have placed on them, we can put them on a path toward recovery. We must first recognize the wounds before we have any hope of healing them.
