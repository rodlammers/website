As Frank Sinatra once crooned [“you can’t have one without the other.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrl_ri4CDF8) He was talking about love and marriage (they “go together like a horse and carriage”) but the same could be said for rivers and sediment. When river scientists talk about sediment, they mean anything from the tiniest clay particles to the largest boulders. This broad range includes sand and gravel which are most often found on the bottom of river channels. While flowing water really makes a river, the channel itself is made of sediment. In fact, the balance between water and sediment is the primary factor controlling the shape and character of river channels.

Imagine a dirt road. This is our river channel. Flowing water is like an infinite series of dump trucks (flowing water) moving dirt (sediment) from one end of the road to another. As long as the dirt supply is sufficient to fill the trucks, everything remains stable.

However, if the dirt supply drops, the dump trucks will start eroding the dirt road to fill themselves.

If, on the other hand, there is too much dirt and the trucks are overloaded, dirt will overflow and spill onto the road.

This analogy (hopefully) illustrates how excess sediment in rivers can cause sediment deposition or aggradation (overloaded dump trucks) while a sediment deficit causes erosion (trucks taking dirt from the road itself). This sediment-water balance is really important because changes in either sediment or water supply can impact river form and behavior.

Sediment is supplied to a river from erosion of the surrounding landscape and land use changes can alter this sediment supply to streams. Land clearing for agriculture or forestry and wildfires can significantly increase the amount of sediment reaching streams, leading to deposition in the stream channel. Urbanization tends to convert natural land cover into paved surfaces which shuts down this natural sediment supply. Dams can also trap significant amounts of sediment, starving downstream sections and leading to substantial erosion.

Water supply to a river can be similarly impacted. Land use change, such as urbanization, can increase the amount of water reaching the stream during each rain event (less vegetation and natural soil cover means less water goes into the ground and more runs off across the surface). This increase in flows in the stream can lead to erosion of the channel unless sediment supplies are also increased. On the other hand, dams and water withdrawals from streams can decrease flows, creating insufficient power to move sediment and leading to aggradation.

These sediment-water imbalances can be very detrimental to rivers. Excessive deposition (especially by fine sediment) can clog streambeds, hurting fish and other aquatic organisms, and can increase flood risk and damage infrastructure. Excessive erosion can be dangerous and damaging for nearby landowners and can contribute excess sediment (and nutrients) to downstream water bodies. Additionally, eroded channels are often poorer fish habitat than more stable rivers and water is confined to the channel rather than allowed to spill out onto the floodplain, further increasing erosion.

Sediment imbalances can cause serious issues even on very large scales. Dams have substantially reduced sediment carried down the Missouri River into the Mississippi. This has caused significant land loss in the Mississippi Delta in Louisiana as less sediment is being deposited to balance out natural erosion processes. The Rio Grande River in New Mexico has been “trapped” within its channel by a long series of levees. Since sediment can no longer be deposited on the floodplains, it is deposited within the stream channel instead. Over time, this has caused the river bottom to rise, necessitating new and higher levees to prevent flooding. Now, the Rio Grande is perched above the surrounding valley; since water seeks the lowest point on a landscape, any flood event that would breach a levee would lead to the creation of an entirely new channel.

Rivers are dynamic, constantly evolving to changing water and sediment supplies. This dynamic nature is often counter to our expectations of rivers as static landscape features but it is an essential part of how rivers function.
