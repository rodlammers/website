Rivers change. They are, by their very nature, dynamic systems which are constantly adjusting to efficiently carry the load of water and sediment they receive. Of course, not all rivers exhibit the same degree of dynamism. Steep streams with abundant sediment are much more mobile than lowland streams. One very visible way that this inherent tendency for change manifests itself is in river planform, that is the view of the river from above. Generally, rivers are split into four categories, from most to least stable: straight, meandering, anastomosing, and braided. This is a somewhat artificial division and an individual river can vary its planform along its length, transitioning from meandering to anastomosing and back again.

A straight stream is, well, pretty straightforward (get it?). They may follow the general curve of the landscape but for the most part head straight downhill. Naturally straight streams are relatively rare but are often very stable. Artificially straightened streams, however, are often highly unstable and may change rapidly as they try to return to their previous equilibrium condition.

A meandering stream is probably what most people imagine rivers looking like: a twisting thread on the landscape. Despite their ubiquity, we really don’t have a great explanation for why rivers exhibit this behavior. Meandering is a widespread phenomenon. Rivulets of water running down a window during a rainstorm meander. So does the Gulf Stream, the ocean current that crosses the Atlantic. The current prevailing thought is that meandering is caused primarily by turbulent flow (really complex and uncertain behavior of flowing water that are difficult, if not impossible, to predict). Once meanders are formed, they don’t remain motionless. Meanders migrate, expand, and pinch off, forming oxbow lakes. The history of these changes is obvious, simply by looking at satellite images. Part C of the image below from the White River in southern Indiana shows active meander cutoffs, old oxbow lakes, and even completely dry remnants of the old river channel.

Moving up the dynamism ladder we reach anastomosing rivers (anastomosing meaning a connection between normally branching things, in this case stream channels). These rivers are sort of hybrids, they have relatively stable channels but instead of being single threaded, they branch and diverge, forming islands. The individual channels that make up the whole can independently move, migrate, and meander.

Braided rivers look like just that, a braid. To spare you my limited descriptive ability, I’ll let Pulitzer Prize winning author John McPhee[^1] describe the Platte, a braided river in Nebraska:

> “From thirty-six thousand feet, as one passes over, the Platte there resembles a braid of cable. Its channels among the gravel bars are so numerous that the river is two miles wide. Choked with rock, the Platte cannot transport its load in any but an awkward way, so it subdivides and loops and braids, and hunts for passage through its own bed.” – John McPhee, “The Gravel Page” in Irons in the Fire, 1997

This passage artfully describes how and why rivers braid. They have abundant sediment loads with shifting channels over this plain of sporadically mobile rock. These streams are common in steeper, more tectonically active regions. Alaska has lots of braided streams; so does New Zealand.

Why is the dynamic nature of rivers so important? Rivers change because they have to. They are constantly adapting to shifts in the water and sediment they receive, trying to carry these loads effectively to the ocean. However, these river channel changes have important biological effects as well. New habitat is created, in the floodplain or in the channel, anytime a river adjusts. Oxbow lakes are important incubators for juvenile fish. Cottonwood trees require fresh, bare sand, deposited by a migrating river, to sprout. The broad and wide Platte River provides water and refuge for the piping plover, least tern, and whopping crane, three endangered migratory birds.

While important for plants and animals, dynamic rivers can be a thorn in the side of human endeavor. Imagine building a bridge across a channel that moves. Picture losing your land to a migrating meander bend. Because of these difficulties, humans tend to “lock” river channels in place, armoring the banks and bed against erosion with stone or concrete. While this can be successful in the short term, rivers will find a way to adjust, and maybe not in the way that best suits our needs. It will be difficult but maybe the better approach is to learn to live with dynamic rivers, after all, they were here first.

[^1]: On a side note, John McPhee is a fantastic writer who can make topics ranging from geology to oranges to cattle branding incredibly fascinating. I highly recommend his work.
