Close your eyes and imagine a river. You are probably picturing a single channel, snaking across the landscape. While many streams follow this general form, it is unclear if this is the result of natural or human-driven processes. Research by Walter and Merritts[^1] presents an entirely new notion: that many small streams in the eastern U.S. follow this common form because of a history of human development. In actuality, these streams should have multiple small channels, crisscrossing within a valley wetland. After European settlement, dam building for water power mills[^2] exploded, along with widespread land clearing for agriculture and timber harvest. Sediment from the hillsides eroded into the valleys where it was trapped behind mill dams, burying the historic wetland/stream complexes. Enough sediment accumulated to fill these small reservoirs and many dams failed. Streams then began to erode through this deposited sediment (up to 16 ft deep), creating the single thread, meandering channels that we see today.

Walter and Merritts used a number of techniques to demonstrate the widespread effects of mill dams. First, they scoured historical written accounts and colonial-era maps to locate old mills. They found that by 1840, there were more than 65,000 water powered mills in the eastern U.S, with some of the highest densities in Massachusetts and southeastern Pennsylvania. They also examined streambank sediments, using radiocarbon dating to show that much of the upper sediment layer was deposited since European settlement. Finally, they used high-resolution topographic data (collected from airplanes using LiDAR, a technique similar to radar except with lasers) to measure the size of the mill dam deposits. With this line of evidence, Walter and Merritts showed not only how ubiquitous mill dams were, but how we are still seeing their legacy today.

These results represent a unique perspective of natural streams in the eastern U.S. This has a variety of implications ranging from future research into fully investigating the extent of mill dam impacts to practical considerations for restoring these damaged streams and improving water quality. Many of the impacted streams drain to the Chesapeake Bay, an important estuary that has been plagued by sediment and nutrient pollution. These eroding mill dam sediments may be significant sources of pollution to the Bay, which could explain why efforts to reduce pollutant loading from urban and agriculture sources have yet to restore water quality. Furthermore, restoration of these streams has been based on the assumption that the single thread, meandering form was desirable. Instead, Walter and Merritts suggest that these streams should be restored to the multi-thread, stream-wetland complexes that existed before European colonization[^3].

Since this paper was published, others have attempted to assess the extent of mill dam impacts on eastern streams. The results have been mixed, suggesting that in some areas mill dams were pervasive and streams are still responding to their effects, while in other areas mill dams may have been less common and had less of an influence on stream form. Still, Walter and Merritts work was groundbreaking and showed just how significant and long-lasting of an impact we can have on our rivers, and reminding us again that we canâ€™t afford to ignore our history.
