How do rivers keep flowing even when it is not raining? Where is that water coming from? California recently suffered from a severe drought (although that has changed lately) but most of their rivers didn’t just dry up. These streams kept flowing because of groundwater. Groundwater acts like a battery. It gets charged when it rains and then slowly releases that water into streams and rivers, providing a continuous “power” source. In fact, the majority of the water that ends up in the stream travels at least part of the way as groundwater. Even during rain storms, 50% or more of the water reaching the stream comes from groundwater[^1].

The interaction between streams and groundwater is a two way street. Gaining streams mostly receive water from groundwater but losing streams are the opposite: stream water leaks into the ground, usually because of deep groundwater tables. In some desert areas, streams dry up moving downstream because so much of the flow is lost to groundwater. In forested areas, vegetation plays a key role in regulating these interactions. Stream water levels may rise and fall daily as streamside trees suck up groundwater during the day, and shut off their pumps at night[^2].

There is a small zone under a stream where the streamwater-groundwater interactions are especially important: the hyporheic zone (from the Greek hypo meaning below and rheos meaning flow). Here, stream water and groundwater are on a roller coaster ride, oscillating between the surface and subsurface. Despite only being a couple of feet thick, the hyporheos is a really important area where lots of exciting chemistry and biology happens. For example, microbes living in this zone filter pollutants out of the water flowing through. Water mixing in the hyporheos also keeps the stream cool, helping fish who can’t stand hot temperatures. Exploring the hyporheic zone is a relatively new area of research and there will likely be many more exciting discoveries.

The connection between streams and groundwater is important for managing these resources. For example, over pumping of groundwater (a critical problem in many areas in the US) can reduce streamflow, hurting fish and downstream water users. Additionally, polluted groundwater doesn’t stay a local problem, it migrates to the stream and the contamination travels downstream. Groundwater is also an important conduit between surface water bodies. Adjacent lakes, or a pond and nearby stream, are often connected via groundwater. Impacts to one of these water bodies will be felt by the nearby lake or stream due to this groundwater link. For a long time, groundwater and stream researchers didn’t communicate. There is even a joke that groundwater hydrologists consider streams “leftover groundwater” that overflowed onto the surface, instead of recognizing them as complex and unique systems of their own. Fortunately, people have recognized the importance of groundwater-stream connections and we are improving our understanding of these linkages to better protect our water resources.
