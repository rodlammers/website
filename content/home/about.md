# Biography

Hi! I'm Rod Lammers, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Georgia. I'm interested in rivers, flooding, water quality, coastal ecoystems, and anything else related to how we use (and abuse) our water resources. I'm currently working with [Brian Bledsoe](https://bledsoe.engr.uga.edu) and team at UGA on projects related to all of these issues.

I'm originally from Indiana and did my undergraduate work at Purdue University. When I'm not studying rivers, coasts, and other amazing ecosystems, I'm out exploring them with my wife.
