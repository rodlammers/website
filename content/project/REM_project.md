### Overview
This project is part of the EPA-funded Center for Comprehensive, optimaL and Effective Abatement of Nutrients (CLEAN). We focused specifically on how channel erosion can impact water quality by supplying sediment-bound phosphorus from eroded channel banks and bed. This work led to the development of the River Erosion Model (REM). REM is an intermediate complexity model for simulating watershed-scale channel evolution and calculating the magnitude of associated channel-derived sediment and phosphorus.

For more information on the development of REM, see our [publication]({{< ref "REM.md" >}}). For REM code and User Guide, see [here](https://github.com/rodlammers/REM).
